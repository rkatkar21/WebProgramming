    <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
    <P>In exercise 1, the code has two mistakes. The first mistake is in the font-family line 
    in which the specified font was missing a quotation, so it should be font-family : "times new roman";
    The second mistake is a missing hyphen in marginleft:2cm. It should be margin-left:2cm.
