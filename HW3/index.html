    <h1>Exercise 2</h1>
    <p>In exercise 1, the code has two mistakes. The first mistake is in the font-family line 
    in which the specified font was missing a quotation, so it should be font-family : "times new roman";
    The second mistake is a missing hyphen in marginleft:2cm. It should be margin-left:2cm. 
    </p>
