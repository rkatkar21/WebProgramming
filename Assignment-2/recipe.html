    <h3>Nutritional Profile</h3>

    <h3>Introduction to Recipe Rating System Chart</h3>
    <p>
        In order to better help you identify recipes that feature a high concentration of nutrients for the calories they contain, we created a Recipe Rating System. 
        This system allows us to highlight the recipes that are especially rich in particular nutrients. The following chart shows the nutrients for
        which 15-Minute Greek Garbanzo Bean Salad is either an excellent, very good, or good source (below the chart you will find a table that explains 
        these qualifications). If a nutrient is not listed in the chart, it does not necessarily mean that the recipe doesn't contain it. It simply means that the 
        nutrient is not provided in a sufficient amount or concentration to meet our rating criteria. (To view this recipe's in-depth nutritional profile that 
        includes values for dozens of nutrients - not just the ones rated as excellent, very good, or good - please use the link below the chart.) To read this chart 
        accurately, you'll need to glance back up to see the ingredients used in the recipe and the number of serving sizes provided by the recipe. Our nutrient ratings
        are based on a single serving. For example, if a recipe makes 4 servings, you would be receiving the nutrient amounts listed in the chart by eating 1/4th of the 
        combined ingredients found in the recipe. Now, returning to the chart itself, you can look next to the nutrient name in order to find the nutrient amount it 
        offers, the percent Daily Value (DV%) that this amount represents, the nutrient density that we calculated for this recipe and nutrient, and the rating we 
        established in our rating system. For most of our nutrient ratings, we adopted the government standards for food labeling that are found in the U.S. Food and 
        Drug Administration's "Reference Values for Nutrition Labeling." Read more background information and details of our rating system.
